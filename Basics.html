What is Web Programming?
              Web programming refers to the writing, markup and coding involved in Web development, which includes Web content, Web client and server scripting and network security. 
The most common languages used for Web programming are XML, HTML, JavaScript, Perl 5 and PHP. Web programming is different from just programming,
which requires interdisciplinary knowledge on the application area, client and server scripting, and database technology.
              Web programming can be briefly categorised into client and server coding. The client side needs programming related to accessing data from users and providing information.
It also needs to ensure there are enough plug ins to enrich user experience in a graphic user interface, including security measures.
To improve user experience and related functionalities on the client side, JavaScript is usually used. It is an excellent client-side platform for designing and implementing Web applications.

HTML5 and CSS3 supports most of the client-side functionality provided by other application frameworks.
The server side needs programming mostly related to data retrieval, security and performance. Some of the tools used here include ASP, Lotus Notes, PHP, Java and MySQL. 
There are certain tools/platforms that aid in both client and server side programming. Some examples of these are Opa and Tersus.
